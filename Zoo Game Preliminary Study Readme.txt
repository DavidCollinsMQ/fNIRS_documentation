Zoo Game Task - Preliminary Study

Triggers:
45	PracticeReady onset - keyboard press
55	BlockIntro onset â€“ keyboard press
50	Fixation cross onset *
101	Go image onset
102	NoGo image onset
3	during stimuli presentation (ie within 500ms of image being presented)
7	during response presentation (ie >500 ms from image being presented)

* Fixation cross jittered (random 10% jitter).

Practice Block Stimulu Count:
Go stimuli	= 9
NoGo stimuli	= 3

Experiment Block Stimulu Count:
Total blocks	= 8
Go per block	= 30
NoGo per block	= 10

Interstimulus Intervals (ISI):
Two experiments conducted per subject with differing durations for Fixation cross display.
1. Fixation cross duration = 1,500ms (+/-10%)
2. Fixation cross duration = 3,000ms (+/-10%)
